# Programmieren Teil 3 
- Wintersemester 2021/ 2022
- simple example of a makefile

## PlugIn
- install IntelliJ PlugIn for "Makefile language" support
  
## How to use the makefile
There are 3 commands possible to use:
- make
- make clean
- make run

Note: 
- use "green arrows" when makefile opened
- or switch to the directory with the terminal and execute commands

### Windows
**make** is not available natively on windows. 

possible solution: 
- install ubuntu through wsl (windows subsystem for linux)
- apt install make
- apt install openjdk-11-jdk 
- navigate to folder with the **make** file. 
- note: c is mounted under /mnt

if all works right. Just open IntelliJ and navigate to **make** file in terminal and enter *bash*. Now you can test the 3 commands.
